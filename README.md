## üìñ Project Overview

The **Loan Management System for Farmers** aims to streamline the lending process between financial institutions and agricultural borrowers. By creating a comprehensive database that captures essential details about farmers, loans, and repayments, this project enables improved decision-making, risk assessment, and performance tracking. Our goal is to enhance the efficiency of loan approvals and support farmers in accessing the necessary capital for their agricultural activities.

üìä Overall Findings
Loan Approval Trends: Larger farms in key agricultural areas tend to get approved for loans more easily than smaller farms.
Repayment Behavior: Most farmers are able to pay back their loans on time, but some are falling behind, indicating financial difficulties.
Farm Size Impact: Bigger farms usually receive larger loans and manage them better.
Regional Differences: Certain areas have higher default rates, suggesting economic conditions vary by region.
Seasonal Trends: Loans peak during planting season, while repayments peak after harvest time.

üöÄ Conclusion
The Loan Management System for Farmers helps track important data about loans and repayments. While many farmers manage their loans well, some need additional help. Understanding the links between farm size, loan performance, and repayment can help banks improve their lending practices. This project shows the value of using data to make informed decisions and can guide future efforts to support farmers more effectively.
